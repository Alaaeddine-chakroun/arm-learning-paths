title: Use Milvus/Zilliz to build RAG on Arm Architecture

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for engineers who want to create a RAG application on Arm machines.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create a simple RAG application using Milvus/Zilliz
    - Launch LLM service on Arm machines

prerequisites:
    - Basic understand of RAG pipeline.
    - An [AWS account](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/aws/) to access instance types with different AWS Graviton processors. 
    - A [Zilliz account](https://zilliz.com/cloud), which you can sign up for a free trial.
