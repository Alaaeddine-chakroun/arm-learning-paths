title: Triggering common PMU events for Neoverse CPUs using C and Assembly 

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software and hardware engineers who want to understand why and how common PMU events are triggered.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand common PMU events
    - Understand why some code triggers certain PMU events on the Neoverse N2 Core
    - Understand which events are triggered during common scenarios

prerequisites:
    - This learning path includes CPU architecture and Arm assembly language that is found in more detail on [Learn the Architecture - A-profile – Arm®](https://www.arm.com/architecture/learn-the-architecture/a-profile). The following sections may be helpful - AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA); AArch64 Memory Management; AArch64 Memory Attributes and Properties; and Memory Systems, Ordering, and Barriers.
