title: ML Ops with Arm-based GitHub Runners

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in automation for machine learning (ML) tasks.

learning_objectives:
    - Set up an Arm-based GitHub runner
    - Use GitHub Actions to set up an ML Ops workflow
    - Train and deploy an ML model with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
    - Use Arm Compute Library to improve the CPU performance


prerequisites:
    - A GitHub account with access to Arm-based GitHub runners
    - Some familiarity with ML and continuos integration and deployment (CI/CD) concepts is assumed
