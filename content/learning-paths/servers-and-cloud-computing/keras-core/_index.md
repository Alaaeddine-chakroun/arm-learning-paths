title: Use Keras Core with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for engineers who want to create a neural network model on Arm machines.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create a simple neural network model using Keras Core
    - Train and evaluate your neural network model with different backends
    - Generate prediction with the generated trained model

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning
    - At least either an [Arm based instance](../csp/) from a cloud service provider, on-premises Arm server, or a Linux virtual machine on your Arm device.
    - Be comfortable with SSH/Linux terminal and basic system administration tasks.
    - To install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
