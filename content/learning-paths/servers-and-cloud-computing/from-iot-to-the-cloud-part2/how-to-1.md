## Why arm64 in the cloud?
A containerization is an approach to software development in which the application, its dependencies, and its configuration are bundled together as a unit called a container image. The container image can then be used to run one or more instances of the application in the form of container instances. 

Using containers, you can ensure that your application will have all the dependencies it needs to run on the end devices, provided the destination device contains a container runtime. Thus, you can make your applications portable. Specifically, you can easily port your apps to the cloud.

Currently, Docker is the most popular tool for containerization. So, in this learning path, I will demonstrate how to create a Docker container image of the existing application. Then, we will push this image to the Azure Container Registry. So, later, it can be deployed to various cloud services.
