We will be running all of our experiments in a Docker container.
Perform the following steps to build the docker container.

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
 clang gdb \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# disable ASLR - needed for some of the experiments
RUN echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
```

Then, build a docker image from the description in the `Dockerfile`, by running
the following command on a command line:

```bash
docker build --tag armlearningpath/bufferoverflow:v1.0 .
```

This will have built the AArch64-linux Docker container in which we will run
the experiments.

Now start the docker environment with the following command:

```bash
docker run -i -t -v $(pwd):/armlearningpaths -w /armlearningpaths --security-opt seccomp=unconfined armlearningpath/bufferoverflow:v1.0
```

This will give you the following prompt inside the docker image that has an
AArch64 Ubuntu 22.04 image. The directory `/armlearningpaths` maps to the
current directory where you ran the `docker run` command. All changes you make
in this directory will persist outside of the docker container.

```bash
root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths#
```
