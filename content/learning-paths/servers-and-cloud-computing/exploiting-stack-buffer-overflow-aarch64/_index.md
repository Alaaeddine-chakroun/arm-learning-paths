title: Exploiting stack buffer overflows on AArch64

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in understanding the basics of how memory vulnerability-based exploits work on AArch64.

learning_objectives: 
   - How a buffer overflow can lead to an attacker controlling the control flow
     of the program, only using regular data inputs to the program.
   - Do the necessary stack frame layout analysis to be able to derive which
     field in user input overwrites the return address stored on the stack.
   - Build a very basic end-to-end exploit by changing the return address to an
     attacker-controlled value.

prerequisites:
    - A computer on which you can create and run a docker image.
    - Be able to read and write basic C code and AArch64 assembly code.
    - Be able to run linux command line commands.
    - Be able to use a gdb debugger.
