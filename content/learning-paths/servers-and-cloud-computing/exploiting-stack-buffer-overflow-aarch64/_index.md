title: Exploiting stack buffer overflows on AArch64

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in understanding the basics of how memory vulnerability-based exploits work on AArch64.

learning_objectives: 
   - Analyze the stack frame layout to derive which
     field in user input overwrites the return address stored on the stack.
   - Build a very basic end-to-end exploit by changing the return address to an
     attacker-controlled value.

prerequisites:
    - A computer using the AArch64 architecture on which you can create and run
      a docker image. We will use gdb in the docker image, and
      [that only works when the docker image and the host computer use the same instruction set](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5191).
    - Some familiarity with reading and writing basic C code and AArch64 assembly code.
    - Some familiarity with running linux command line commands.
    - Some familiarity with using a gdb debugger.
