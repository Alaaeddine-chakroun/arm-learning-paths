In follow-on arm learning paths, we will build on these skills to build a full
exploit turning a buffer overflow vulnerability into an arbitrary code execution
capability. We will also explore which mitigations have been deployed to make
building these exploits harder.

If you can't wait and would like to continue exploring this topic further, one
useful resource is the
