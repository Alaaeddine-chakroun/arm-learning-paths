## Summary ##

In this Learning Path, you have created an Android application to capture and process camera images using OpenCV:

* Firstly, you integrated the OpenCV library into your Android project. 

* Secondly, you enabled camera permissions to ensure the application can access the device’s camera. 

* Thirdly, you set up `JavaCameraView` to capture real-time frames from the camera. You declared and initialized Mat objects to store and process camera frames. 

* Finally, you implemented adaptive thresholding using OpenCV’s `Imgproc.adaptiveThreshold` to process the camera frames when a checkbox is checked.

By following these steps, you have successfully created an Android application that captures real-time images from the camera.
