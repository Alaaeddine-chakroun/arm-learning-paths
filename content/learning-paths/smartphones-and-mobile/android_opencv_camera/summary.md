## Summary ##

In this learning path, you created an Android application to capture and process camera images using OpenCV. First, you integrated the OpenCV library into your Android project. Then, you enabled camera permissions to ensure the application can access the device’s camera. Next, you set up `JavaCameraView` to capture real-time frames from the camera. You declared and initialized Mat objects to store and process camera frames. Finally, you implemented adaptive thresholding using OpenCV’s `Imgproc.adaptiveThreshold` to process the camera frames when a CheckBox is checked.

By following these steps, you successfully created an Android application that captures real-time images from the camera, processes them using OpenCV, and displays the processed images, demonstrating adaptive thresholding.
