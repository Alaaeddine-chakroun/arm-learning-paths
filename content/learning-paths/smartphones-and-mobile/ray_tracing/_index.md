title: Introduction to Ray tracing with Vulkan on Android

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: Vulkan developers who are familiar with rendering and are interested in adding ray tracing to their applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Learn how the Vulkan ray tracing API works.
    - Learn how to use ray tracing to implement realistic shadows, reflections and refractions.
    - Implement basic ray tracing effects in a Vulkan renderer.

prerequisites:
    - An appropriate Android device (e.g., Vivo X100) supporting the required Vulkan extensions.
    - Knowledge of the Vulkan API.
    - A Vulkan renderer. Most code is generic and should be easy to incorporate into any deferred PBR renderer.
