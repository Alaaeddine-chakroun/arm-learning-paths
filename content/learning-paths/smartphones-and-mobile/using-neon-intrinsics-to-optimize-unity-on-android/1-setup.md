In this learning path you will learn how to improve the performance of your apps and games by  using Unityâ€™s Burst compiler and further by using Neon intrinsics. You will use the Profiler and Analyzer tools to measure and compare performance between unoptimized, Burst compiler and Neon intrinsic versions of the provided sample code.

## Install Unity with Android build support
This learning path requires Unity with Android build support. You can either follow the steps on the [Unity download page](https://unity.com/download) or follow the learning path [Get started with Unity on Android](/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/get-started-with-unity-on-android).

## Install the sample project
You will also need the collision sample project from the previous learning path.

Create a new 3D URP project from the Unity Hub
Open your new project in Unity
Go to the Unity Asset Store in a browser and download and install the sample project [Optimizing Collisions with Burst and Neon Intrinsics](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/optimizing-collisions-with-burst-and-neon-intrinsics-196303)
Allow the importer to overwrite existing project settings

For more detailed instructions you can follow the steps in [Profiling Unity apps on Android](/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/profiling-unity-apps-on-android).
