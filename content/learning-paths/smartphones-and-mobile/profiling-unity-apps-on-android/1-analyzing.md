This learning path will guide you through your first steps in analyzing the performance of a sample application on an Android device.

The sample project has been written in Unity and is freely available on the Unity Asset Store. You will build and deploy the application to your Android device.

We have covered building and deploying Unity applications for profiling on Android devices in the learning path [Get started with Unity on Android](/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/get-started-with-unity-on-android)

You will then use the Profiler and Analyzer tools to collect and analyze performance data. While the Profiler is focused more on examining specific frames, the Analyzer allows developers to compare frames over time or between two different captures (for example, before and after a change to the code).
