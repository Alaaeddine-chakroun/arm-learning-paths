title: Detect faces with OpenCV on Arm64-powered Android Devices

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an intermediate topic for developers who are interested in creating Computer Vision applications with OpenCV on Arm64-powered Android devices. 

learning_objectives:
   - Describe how you can use OpenCV for face detection.   
   - Acquire images from the camera.
   - Use Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with [OpenCV getting started](/content/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/android_opencv_camera).
    - A development computer with Android Studio  installed (this Learning Path uses Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Patch 1).
