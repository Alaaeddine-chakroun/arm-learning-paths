title: Running MCA with Arm assembly

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for Arm developers who want to diagnose performance issues of Arm programs using MCA and Compiler Explorer.

learning_objectives:
    - Estimate the hardware resource pressure and the number of cycles taken to execute your code snippet using llvm-mca
    - Understand how this estimate can help diagnose possible performance issues
    - Use Compiler Explorer to run llvm-mca

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with Arm assembly
    - clang compiler or access to Compiler Explorer
