title: Run Llama 3 on a Raspberry Pi 5 using ExecuTorch

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for anyone interested in running the Llama 3 model on a Raspberry Pi 5. It also touches on techniques for running large language models (LLMs) in an embedded environment.

learning_objectives:
    - Use AWS and Docker to emulate an embedded operating system.
    - Compile a Large Language Model (LLM) using ExecuTorch.
    - Deploy the Llama 3 model on an edge device.


prerequisites:
    - A valid [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
    - (optional) A Raspberry Pi 5.
