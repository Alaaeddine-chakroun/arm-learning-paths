title: Learn how to create the PyTorch model for digit classification
minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in learning how to use PyTorch to create a feedforward neural network for digit classification. 

learning_objectives:
    - Prepare the environment.
    - Understand the MNIST digit dataset.
    - Create a neural network architecture using PyTorch.

prerequisites:
    - A x86_64 or Apple development machine with Code Editor (we recommend Visual Studio Code).
