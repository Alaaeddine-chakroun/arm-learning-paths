title: KleidiAI basics - Improving AI/ML workloads from servers to phones

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for people wanting to learn how Generative AI workloads execute on hardware, and how KleidiAI accelerates it.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand how basic math operations power Large Language Models.
    - Learn how the KleidiAI micro-kernels speed up Generative AI inference performance.
    - Run a basic C++ matrix multiplication example to showcase the speedup the KleidiAI micro-kernels deliver.
    
prerequisites:
    - An Arm Linux machine that implements the *i8mm* architecture feature; this example uses an AWS Graviton 3 instance.
    - A basic understanding of linear algebra terminology such as dot product and matrix multiplication.
