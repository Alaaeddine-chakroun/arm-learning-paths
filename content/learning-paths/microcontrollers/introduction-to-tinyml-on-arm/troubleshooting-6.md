## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter permission issues, try running the commands with sudo.
- Ensure your Grove - Vision AI Module V2 is properly connected and recognized by your computer.
- If Edge Impulse CLI fails to detect your device, try unplugging and replugging the USB cable.

## Best Practices
- Always cross-compile your code on the host machine to ensure compatibility with the target Arm device.
- Utilize model quantization techniques to optimize performance on constrained devices like the Grove - Vision AI Module V2.
- Regularly update your development environment and tools to benefit from the latest improvements in TinyML and edge AI technologies

You've now set up your environment for TinyML development on the Grove - Vision AI Module V2. In the next modules, we'll explore data collection, model training, and deployment using PyTorch v2.0 and Executorch.
