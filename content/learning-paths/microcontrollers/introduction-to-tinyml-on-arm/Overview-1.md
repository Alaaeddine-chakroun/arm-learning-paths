## Module Overview 
This session delves into TinyML, which applies machine learning to devices with limited resources like microcontrollers. This module serves as a starting point for learning how cutting-edge AI technologies may be put on even the smallest of devices, making Edge AI more accessible and efficient. 

Additionally, we'll cover the necessary setup on your host machine and target device to facilitate cross-compilation and ensure smooth integration across all devices.

## Introduction to TinyML
TinyML represents a significant shift in how we approach machine learning deployment. Unlike traditional machine learning, which typically depends on cloud-based servers or high-powered hardware, TinyML is tailored to function on devices with limited resources, such as constrained memory, power, and processing capabilities. TinyML has quickly gained popularity because it enables AI applications to operate in real-time, directly on the device, with minimal latency, enhanced privacy, and the ability to work offline. This shift opens up new possibilities for creating smarter and more efficient embedded systems.
