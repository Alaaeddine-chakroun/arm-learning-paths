title: Introduction to TinyML on Arm using PyTorch v2.0 and Executorch

minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: This learning module is tailored for developers, engineers, and data scientists who are new to TinyML and interested in exploring its potential for edge AI. If you have an interest in deploying machine learning models on low-power, resource-constrained devices, this course will help you get started using PyTorch v2.0 and Executorch on Arm-based platforms.

learning_objectives: 
    - Identify TinyML and how it's different from the AI you might be used to.
    - Understand the benefits of deploying AI models on Arm-based edge devices.
    - Select Arm-based devices for TinyML.
    - Identify real-world use cases demonstrating the impact of TinyML in various industries.
    - Install and configure a TinyML development environment.
    - Set up a cross-compilation environment on your host machine.
    - Perform best practices for ensuring optimal performance on constrained edge devices.


prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.
    - Understanding of IoT and embedded systems (helpful but not required).
